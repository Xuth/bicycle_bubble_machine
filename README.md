code associated with my bicycle bubble machine

This is the code (design and microcontroller) that is associated with my bicycle bubble machine.  It wasn't designed to be shared but enough people wanted to see it/try to replicate it that I'm putting up the code mostly as is or with a few quick edits to help someone figure out how to use it if they have a good idea of what they're looking at.  As I've said elsewhere, this was a whimsical project I created, mostly for myself.
